## 🧾 Summary
The auth microservice is well-structured, utilizing NestJS, GraphQL Federation, Mongoose, and Redis for session management. The implementation of RBAC is present, but there are areas for improvement in security and code quality.

---

## ❌ Critical Issues

- The JWT secret is hardcoded in the codebase. It should be sourced from environment variables to avoid exposure.
- The refresh token strategy uses the same secret as the access token, which is not a recommended practice. Consider using a different secret for refresh tokens.


## ⚠️ Warnings

- The error handling in the GraphQL exception filter could be improved to provide more context on errors.
- The use of 'any' in several places (e.g., in the AuthService and decorators) can lead to potential type safety issues. Consider using more specific types.
- The 'refreshToken' field in AuthResponse is marked as a string but is not supported in the current implementation. This could lead to confusion.


## 💡 Suggestions

- Implement rate limiting on login and signup mutations to prevent brute force attacks.
- Consider adding logging for failed login attempts to monitor potential security threats.
- Ensure that sensitive information (like passwords) is never logged or exposed in error messages.
- Review the use of 'any' types and replace them with more specific types to enhance type safety.
- Add unit tests for the RBAC service to ensure that role and permission checks are functioning as expected.
